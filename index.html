    <h1>Zelda: Ocarina of Time</h1>
    <p>Zelda: Ocarina of Time, also known as Zelda 64, came out in 1998.  It revolutionized the art of 3D gaming with its Z-Targeting mode for fighting enemies.  It is also my favorite game of all time, I am playing through it right now.  I just arrived at the Shadow Temple and I can't wait to get the hover boots and fight Bongo Bongo.  I think that is the boss' name.  Oingo Boingo is a band from the 80s but that has nothing to do with this so stop typing about it.  Okay, Zelda is great, before Breath of the Wild there was the almighty Ocarina of Time.</p>
